POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK
A child thinks 20 shillings and 20 years can scarce ever be spent2A cold April the barn will fill.
A countryman between two lawyers is like a fish between two cats4Act uprightly and despise calumny; dirt may stick to a mud wall but not to polish'd marble5A cypher and humility make the other figures and virtues of tenfold value6A false friend and a shadow attend only while the sun shines
A father's a treasure ; a brother's a comfort ; a friend is both
A fat kitchen a lean will
A fine genius in his own country is like gold in the mine
A flatterer never seems absurd : The flatter'd always takes his word
After three days men grow weary of a wench a guest and weather rainy
After crosses and losses men grow humbler and wiser
A full belly is the mother of all evil
A full belly makes a dull brain
A good example is the best sermon
A good lawyer a bad neighbor
A good man is seldom uneasy an ill one never easy
A house without woman and firelight is like a body without soul or sprite
A lean award is better than a fat judgment
A learned blockhead is a greater blockhead than an ignorant one
A lie stands on one leg truth on two
A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things
A light purse is a heavy curse
A little house well fill'd a little field well till'd and a little wife well will'd are great riches
All blood is alike ancient
All mankind are beholden to him that is kind to the good
All things are cheap to the saving dear to the wasteful
POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACKIt 
All would live long but none would be old
A long life may not be good enough but a good life is long enough
"31A man in a passion rides a mad horse
A man without a wife, is but a half a man
A man without ceremony has need of great merit in its place
Ambition often spends foolishly what avarice had wickedly collected
A mob's a monster; heads enough, but no brains
A modern wit is one of David's fools
An egg today is better than a hen to- morrow
An empty bag cannot stand upright
A new truth is a truth, an old error is an error, though Clodpate won't al- low either

An hundred thieves cannot strip one naked man, especially if his skin's off
An ill wound, but not an ill name, may be healed
An innocent plowman is more worthy than a vicious prince
Anoint a villian and he'll stab you; stab him, and he'll anoint you
An old man in a house is a good sign
An old young man will be a young old man
An ounce of wit that is bought, is worth a pound that is taught
An undutiful daughter, will prove an unmanageable wife
A pair of good ears will drain dry an hundred tongues
A plowman on his legs is higher than 
a gentleman on his knees
Approve not of him that commends all you say
A quarrelsome man has no good neighbors
A quiet conscience sleeps in thunder
Are you angry that others disappoint you? Remember you cannot depend upon yourself
As charms are nonsense, nonsense is 
a charm
Ask and have, is sometimes dear buy- ing
A soft tongue may strike hard
As pride increases, fortune declines
As sore places meet most rubs, proud folks meet most affronts
A temper to bear much, will have 
much to bear
A wicked hero will turn his back to 
an innocent coward
As we must account for every idle word, so we must for every idle silence
At a great pennyworth, pause a 
while
A traveller should have a hog's nose, deer's legs, and an ass's back
At the working man's house hunger 
looks in but dares not enter
At 20 years of age the will reigns ; at thirty the wit ; at 40 the judgment
Bad commentators spoil the best of books
Bad gains are truly losses
Bargaining has neither friends nor 
relations
Be always ashamed to catch thyself 
idle
Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors
Beauty and folly are old companions
'76Being ignorant is not so much a shame, as being unwilling to learn
Ben beats his pate, and fancys wit will come ; but he may knock, there's nobody at home
Be not niggardly of what costs thee nothing, as courtesy, counsel, and countenance
Be slow in choosing a friend, slower in changing
Better is a little with content than 
much with contention
Better slip with foot than tongue
Beware, beware! He'll cheat without scruple, who can without fear
Beware of him that is slow to anger ; he is angry for something, and will not be pleased for nothing
Beware of little expenses, a small leak will sink a great ship

Beware of the young doctor and the old barber
Blame-all and praise-all are two block heads

By diligence and patience, the 
mouse bit in two the cable

Children and princes will quarrel for trifles
Clean your finger, before you point at my spots
Clearly spoken, MrFog! You ex- plain English by Greek

Content is the philosopher's stone, that turns all it touches into gold

Courage would fight, but discretion won't let him
Creditors have better memories than debtors
Cut the wings of your hens and hopes, lest they lead you a wary dance after them
Danger is sauce for prayers

Diligence is the mother of good luck
Diligence overcomes difficulties, sloth makes them
Distrust and caution are the parents of security
Do good to thy friend to keep him, to thy enemy to gain him
Doing an injury puts you below your enemy; revenging one makes you but even with him ; forgiving, it sets you above him
Do not do that which you would not have known
Do me the favor to deny me at once
Don't go to the doctor with every distemper, nor to the lawyer with every quarrel, nor to the pot for every thirst
Don't judge of men's wealth or piety, by their Sunday appearances
Don't misinform your doctor nor your lawyer
Don't overload gratitude; if you d&gt; she'll kick
Don't think to hunt two hares with one dog
Don't throw stones at your neigh- bors, if your own windows are glass
Don't value a man for the quality he is of, but for the qualities he pos- sesses
Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time; for that's the stuff life is made of
Drink does not drown care, but waters it, and makes it grow faster
Drink water ; put the money in your pocket, and leave the dry-bellyache in the punch-bowl
Drive thy business, or it will drive thee
Drunkenness, that worst of evils, makes some men fools, some beasts, some devils

Experience keeps a dear school, yet 
fools will learn in no other
Eyes and priests bear no jests
Fear God, and your enemies will fear you
Fear not death ; for the sooner we die, the longer shall we be im- mortal
Fear to do ill, and you need fear nought else
Fine linen, girls and gold so bright, choose not to take by candle light
Fish and visitors stink in three days
Fly pleasures and they'll follow you
Fond pride of dress is sure an empty curse ; e'er fancy you consult, consult your purse
Fools make feasts, and wise men eat 'em
Fools multiply folly
Fools need advice most, but wise men only are the better for it
For age and want save while you may; no morning sun lasts a whole day
For one poor man there are an hun- dred indigent
For want of a nail the shoe is lost; for want of a shoe, the horse is lost ; for want of a horse the rider is lost, 
Friendship cannot live with cere- mony, nor without civility
Friendship increases by visiting friends, but by visiting seldom
Full of courtesy, full of craft

Great modesty often hides great merit
Great spenders are bad lenders
Great talkers, little doers
 /Great talkers should be cropt, for they've no need of ears

shuts up his countenance

every matter

There was never a good knife made 
of bad steel
They who have nothing to trouble 
them will be troubled at nothing
The rivers and bad governments the lightest things swim at top
The rotten apple spoils his com- 
panion
The royal crown cures not the head- ache
The same man cannot be both friend 
and flatterer
The sleeping fox catches no poultry
Up! up! 
The second vice is lying; the first is 
running in debt
The sting of a reproach is the truth 
of it
The sun never repents of the good 
he does nor does he ever demand a recompence
The things which hurt instruct
The tongue is ever turning to the 
aching tooth
The tongue offends and the ears get 
the cuffing
The too obliging temper is evermore 
disobliging itself
The way to be safe is never to be 
secure
The way to see by faith is to shut the Eye of ReasonThe morning daylight appears plainer when you put out your candle
The wise man draws more advan- 
tage from his enemies than the fool from his friends
The worst wheel of the cart makes 
the most noise
The wolf sheds his coat once a year his disposition never
Think of three things whence you came where you are going and to whom you must account
Thirst after desert not reward
Tho' modesty is a virtue bashful- ness is a vice
Those that have much business 
must have much pardon
Those who are fear'd are hated
Those who in quarrels interpose 
must often wipe a bloody nose
Tho' the mastiff be gentle yet bite 
him not by the lip
Thou canst not joke an enemy into 
a friend; but thou may'st a friend into an enemy
Three good meals a day is bad liv- 
ing
Three may keep a secret if two of 
them are dead
Three things are men most likely to be cheated in a horse a wig and a wife
Tim and his handsaw are good in their place tho' not fit for preaching or shaving a face
Time enough always proves little enough
Time is an herb that cures all dis- eases
Tim was so learned that he could name a horse in nine languagesSo ignorant that he bought a cow to ride on
'Tis against some men's principle to pay interest and seems against others' interest to pay the principal
'Tis a laudable ambition that aims 
at being better than his neighbors
'Tis a shame that your family is an honor to you ! You ought to be an honor to your family
'Tis a strange forest that has no rotten wood in it and a strange kin- dred that all are good in it
'Tis better leave for an enemy at 
one's d^ath than beg of a friend in one's life
J Tis easier to build two chimneys 
than maintain one in fuel
'Tis easier to prevent bad habits 
tnan to break them
